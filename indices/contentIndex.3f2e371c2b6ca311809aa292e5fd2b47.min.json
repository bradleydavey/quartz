I was expelled from high school when I was 15 years and court-ordered to obtain my GED at 16. I've since been on a journey of learning about learning. When you lack a formal education you must learn new ideas in new ways and from and with new people. This has been both a challenge and a blessing in my life. This website is my attempt to make sense of my experiences and dialog with folks on their own learning journeys. \n\nI'm currently at Northwestern University, pursuing a doctoral degree in [[learning sciences]]. My research interests -- and frankly my existence -- are grounded in liberatory educational experiences. That is, learning environments and moments that are inextricably interwoven with critical answers to critical questions of epistemology (whose knowledge matters?) and ontology (whose existence matters?). As much of my background is also rooted in science, particularly organic chemistry, I am curious about: what do we learn about chemistry, why, when, where, and from whom and for whom? \n\nWe find ourselves in an era of accountability and standards, where school communities adhere to 'expert' understandings of science -- largely [[Michael Lynch on Expertise|defined by those who work in academia]] (not unironically like myself). As such, and applying my curiosity questions to this paradigm, we may often find that we learn 'ready made chemistry' because we are told to learn chemistry in enclosed school environments separated from one's other communities. We are told to learn chemistry because it will help us in the future: for college and for jobs. We are also told to learn chemistry because we have no other choice, and if we engage in epistemic disobedience, we are expelled from school. We learn standards for standard-makers, mostly from 'experts' and for ourselves and our 'futures' -- not our families or our communities. While all of this is true, it does not have to be true. Thus, I'm interested in investigating how we change the status quo, why we do so, and for and with whom these changes happen.\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, write me on twitter and let's connect.","lastmodified":"2022-11-26T14:51:05.261931303Z","tags":null},"/Conner-C.-2005-A-Peoples-History-of-Science-MOC":{"title":"Conner, C. - 2005 - A People's History of Science MOC","content":"\n## Main Ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n## Related Sources\n\n\n## Literature Notes\n\n\n-----------\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-26T14:51:05.261931303Z","tags":null},"/Fores-M.-1983-Science-and-the-Neolithic-Paradox":{"title":"Fores - 1983 - Science and the ‘Neolithic Paradox’","content":"\nFores, M.

If man is put 'to the question' along with 'science', it can be seen how: first, human rationality at work is impossible; second, the notion ofa discernible and distinctive 'scientific method' is as mythic as that of a 'cooking method', or an 'engineering method', or a 'method of management'.” \n\u003e \n\u003e -- (Fores, 1983, p. 160)\n\n\u003e “What has to be realized, is that a tool is a type of machine; and the human actor takes up, as in the case of man with man, a division of labour with machines in the work-place.

Man is given his job to do, because he is relatively good at dealing with risk and the unknown. Given this, he can neither afford to try to be rational, in the sense of operating for reasons which are apparent ex ante; nor should he sensibly aim to be 'methodical', in the sense of basing his conduct on articulable propositions.\"” \n\u003e \n\u003e -- (Fores, 1983, p. 161)\n\n\u003e “The greatest single trouble with the totemism of 'science' which has been discussed in this paper, concerns the way in which the special respect for 'science' has led to an apparent confirmation of the [[mechanomorphic]] view of man, which adheres to the 'humane' stance criticized by Collingwood in the passage from which a quotation was taken at the end of the previous section. If man is celebrated as a 'rational' being or as one which strives to act in such a way, the celebrant tends to lose sight of the fact that it is machine-behaviour which is characteristically more rational than that of human actors, in the sense discussed above; man is characteristically skillful in contrast. With accounts by the 'moderns', about an animate, powerful (*kräftig*) , anthropomorphic 'science', it is inevitable that man appears relatively inanimate, skill-less (craft-free), and (rationally) machine-like; the ritualistic celebration of a mythic 'scientific method' has contributed to this aberration.” \n\u003e \n\u003e -- (Fores, 1983, p. 161)\n\n\n\u003e “First, the totemic celebration of 'science' has to be excised from any record whose compiler wishes to be classed as scientific himself.

These are certainly not a function of different stages of development of the human mind but rather of two strategic levels at which nature is accessible to scientific enquiry: one roughly adapted to that of perception and the imagination: the other at a remove from it. It is as if the necessary connections which are the object of all science, neolithic or modern, could be arrived at by two different routes, one very close to, and the other more remote from, sensible intuition.\n\u003e \n\u003e -- Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1962, The Science of the Concrete, p. 9\n\nThe paradox is how modern science came to be. A question can get this going: Prior to the existence (the human construction) of the modern scientific laboratory, did science exist? Given the tens of thousands of years of ‘practical’ (as polite code for ‘subjective’ and ‘not rigorous’) knowledge produced prior to modern laboratory science, how did science come to be? This isn't a historical question to be answered by looking at how humans formed institutions and how those institutions formed science. Some folks do that well, though: \n- [[Secord]]\n- [[Conner, C. - 2005 - A People's History of Science MOC]]\n\nRather, this is a question of human's interact with nature in the absence of institutional forces. \n\nThis plays into the ‘fairy tale’ story of modern science [[Woolgar, S. - 1988 - Science, the very idea MOC]], as if science somehow birthed, and now certifies [[Rouse, J. - 1996 - Beyond Epistemic Sovereignty]], itself. The paradox is how science could possibly come from non-science. *The*, not a, solution must be that nature has always been accessible by two means: that of disembodied cognitive processes removed from nature, and that of embodied, situated processes that get up close and personal with nature. Modern images of science would have us believe that the former is all is possible and that the latter is non-science. Ethnographic studies of science reveal, however, ‘the soft underbelly’ of scientific knowledge production, unraveling clean Cartesian divides between the mind and body, and unifying body and mind as one to advance science. \n\nWhat the heck does that mean? If nature was accessible to scientific inquiry prior to the invention of the modern laboratory which places nature at a remove from perception of imagination, then how did science come into existence? We have to acknowledge the ease of clean dichotomies, and this is certainly one. The validity of Lévi-Strauss' knowledge claim is something to question, but what if it plays out? \n\nOne way it plays out is that civilizations experience a 'long pause' in scientific activity. The Dark Ages, right? All of human, scientific activity prior to the explosion of 'scientific' activity in the modern era as well. But the paradox reshapes that view. There was no pause, no great divide. Scientific activity took a different form. Some folks call these forms [[ethnobotany]], [[related]], and [[related]]. \n\n\u003e Their principal value is indeed to preserve until the present time the remains of methods of observation and reflection which were (and no doubt still are) precisely adapted to discoveries of a certain type: those which nature authorised from the starting point of a speculative organization and exploitation of the sensible world in sensible terms. This science of the concrete was necessarily restricted by its essence to results other than those destined to be achieved by the exact natural sciences but it was no less scientific and its results no less genuine. They were secured ten thousand years earlier and still remain at the basis of our own civilization. \n\u003e \n\u003e -- Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1962, The Science of the Concrete, p. 10-11\n\n\nA related work is [[Conner, C. - 2005 - A People's History of Science MOC]]\nAnd [[Michael Lynch on Expertise]] also discusses who gets to count what and how\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-26T14:51:05.265931418Z","tags":null},"/MOCs-Database":{"title":"What's an MOC?","content":"\nA Map of Content (MOC) is an interrelated set of ideas organized around a core topic.

Russ outlines an argument here that science education's emphasis on the *practices* of *professional scientists*\" sets up a tacit model of learning:\n\n![[Pasted image 20221126084748.png]]\nAnd Russ then argues for a new model:\n\n![[Pasted image 20221126084808.png]]\n\nI use quotes around \"professional scientists\" because it is clear in Russ' argument (and in the accounts of practices that I've read) that the scientists we ask learners to emulate are not at all professional. ==In fact, they aren't even people; they're scientific journal articles.== Russ' references make this clear (Dewey, Schwab, and Chin \u0026 Malhotra). Notably missing are the decades of ethnographic fieldwork of scientific activity. Why do science education researchers rarely draw on the ethnographic work done in laboratories?\n\nNow, of course, Russ' argument against the tacit model of science education proposes its own tacit model, namely that the heretofore scholarship of practice has *actually* advanced the practices of professional scientists. It hasn't. In fact, it would be quite challenging to do. One of my principal understandings of ethnographic fieldwork of laboratory action is that there are not coherent, core scientific practices. This doesn't matter much in light of Russ' substitution: we should replace emphases of laboratory science with emphases on productive epistemologies (drawing on Elby \u0026 Hammer, 2001). That's all fine and good, but we do start to wade into murky water: how do we define productive? how do we evaluate it? productive toward what ends?\n\n==If there's one argument I can get behind here, it's:==\n\n\u003e No longer would we be able to justify examining or promoting particular epistemologies or practices in science class merely because scientists do it.\n\u003e \n\u003e -- Russ, 2014, p. 392 \n\nBecause the argument that learners should do something because scientists do it, is quite frankly, boring. Not only is this argument fallacious -- science education researchers largely do not know what actual scientists do, as evidenced by their literature base -- it also fails to take up one of the central arguments of the literature that it *should* reference. \n\nScience education research, by not taking up ethnographic fieldwork of scientific activities, advances a scientific mythology (a 'fairy tale' science; McDermott \u0026 Webber, 1998). In addition, science education research fails to engage in an inversion process called for by some of this myth-busting literature. In particular, Woolgar's (1988) work:\n\n![[Pasted image 20221126084817.png]]\n\nThe image above is the classic view of science: the scientist represents nature (embodied as an object).\n\n![[Pasted image 20221126084824.png]]\n\nAnd thus, scientific knowledge is a representation of the natural world.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221126084831.png]]\n\nWhat if, however, it could be shown that scientific knowledge came first and gave rise to the natural world? What if how we choose to represent the natural world ('scientific knowledge') determines the natural world itself? If we expand this representation-object couple out into a process, we could find:\n\n![[Pasted image 20221126084842.png]]\n\nThe main mode of representation in science (i.e., scientific journal articles; the leading image of science within science education; notably *not* scientists) is produced. This document is now advanced as the thing itself because few scientists are going to actually do the work of investigating the original object. The object, now advanced by the document, becomes divorced from the document. They are on equal  ontological footing: the object always existed in nature (e.g., an electron) and now the document also exists in a one-to-one capacity. If that's the case, then through some argumentation we can make it clear that the object existed first, and that the document simply represents it. And through a series of erasure (e.g., removing the human scientist from the journal article) we show that none of the documenting (the representing) matters, or perhaps ignore that it was even done, and we've come full circle:\n\n![[Pasted image 20221126084848.png]]\n\nSo a question we have to ask ourselves is: if we've represented scientists' practices (which most science education researchers have not), have we done so in a way that sets up a false image? Are scientific practices ('science' practices in reform documents) the object or the representation in our scholarship? What implications might this have for science education?\n\nOne implication is clear. The following image becomes non-sensical: \n\n![[Pasted image 20221126084852.png]]\n\nBecause there never was such a thing as the left-hand part of the image. I think Russ' argument does a fine job of moving in the direction of falsifying leading images of scientific practice in science education. In particular, it's emphasis on epistemologies outside of science moves us outside of the laboratory and into the wider world. This is necessary. I have lots of questions about where we go now and why, but do agree with Russ on the idea that:\n\n\u003e Much of the work in the field has been in highlighting discontinuity between scientists’ and learners’ epistemologies, thereby reinforcing a deficit model of learners.\n\u003e \n\u003e -- Russ, 2014, p. 390\n\nBut, Russ doesn't take this far enough for me. A few steps more and we'd deconstruct the mythology of scientific epistemologies all-together: the greater deficit model of thinking that proposes scientific thinking at the top of a hierarchy. And a few steps more and we can now question the discipline divides that pervade American schooling.","lastmodified":"2022-11-26T14:51:05.265931418Z","tags":null},"/Scientific-practice-and-ordinary-action-ethnomethodology-and-social-studies-of-science":{"title":"Review: Lynch (1993) Scientific practice and ordinary action","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-26T14:51:05.265931418Z","tags":null},"/Woolgar-S.-1988-Science-the-very-idea-MOC":{"title":"Science, the very idea MOC","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-26T14:51:05.265931418Z","tags":null},"/philosophy":{"title":"philosophy","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-26T14:51:05.265931418Z","tags":null}}
