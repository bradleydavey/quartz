I was expelled from high school when I was 15 years and court-ordered to obtain my GED at 16. I've since been on a journey of learning about learning. When you lack a formal education you must learn new ideas in new ways and from and with new people. This has been both a challenge and a blessing in my life. This website is my attempt to make sense of my experiences and dialog with folks on their own learning journeys. \n\nI'm currently at Northwestern University, pursuing a doctoral degree in [[learning sciences]]. My research interests -- and frankly my existence -- are grounded in liberatory educational experiences. That is, learning environments and moments that are inextricably interwoven with critical answers to critical questions of epistemology (whose knowledge matters?) and ontology (whose existence matters?). As much of my background is also rooted in science, particularly organic chemistry, I am curious about: what do we learn about chemistry, why, when, where, and from whom and for whom? \n\nWe find ourselves in an era of accountability and standards, where school communities adhere to 'expert' understandings of science -- largely [[Michael Lynch on Expertise|defined by those who work in academia]] (not unironically like myself). As such, and applying my curiosity questions to this paradigm, we may often find that we learn 'ready made chemistry' because we are told to learn chemistry in enclosed school environments separated from one's other communities. We are told to learn chemistry because it will help us in the future: for college and for jobs. We are also told to learn chemistry because we have no other choice, and if we engage in epistemic disobedience, we are expelled from school. We learn standards for standard-makers, mostly from 'experts' and for ourselves and our 'futures' -- not our families or our communities. While all of this is true, it does not have to be true. Thus, I'm interested in investigating how we change the status quo, why we do so, and for and with whom these changes happen.\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, write me on twitter and let's connect.","lastmodified":"2022-11-23T15:02:44.728277547Z","tags":null},"/ISLS-2023-Submissions":{"title":"ISLS 2023 Submissions","content":"\nThe International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS) is a conference hosted by the learning sciences [[On Becoming a Learning Scientist|(Learning Sciences?)]] 'premier' society: The [Iternational Society of the Learning Sciences](https://www.isls.org/).

These are certainly not a function of different stages of development of the human mind but rather of two strategic levels at which nature is accessible to scientific enquiry: one roughly adapted to that of perception and the imagination: the other at a remove from it. It is as if the necessary connections which are the object of all science, neolithic or modern, could be arrived at by two different routes, one very close to, and the other more remote from, sensible intuition.\n\u003e \n\u003e -- Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1962, The Science of the Concrete, p. 9\n\nThe paradox is how modern science came to be, given the tens of thousands of years of ‘practical’ (as polite code for ‘subjective’ and ‘not rigorous’) knowledge produced prior to its existence. This plays into the ‘fairy tale’ story of modern science [[Woolgar, S. - 1988 - Science, the very idea MOC]], as if science somehow birthed, and now certifies [[Rouse, J. - 1996 - Beyond Epistemic Sovereignty]], itself. The paradox is how science could possibly come from non-science. *The*, not a, solution must be that nature has always been accessible by two means: that of disembodied cognitive processes removed from nature, and that of embodied, situated processes that get up close and personal with nature. Modern images of science would have us believe that the former is all is possible and that the latter is non-science. Ethnographic studies of science reveal, however, ‘the soft underbelly’ of scientific knowledge production, unraveling clean Cartesian divides between the mind and body, and unifying body and mind as one to advance science. \n\nWhat the heck does that mean? If nature was accessible to scientific inquiry prior to the invention of the modern laboratory which places nature at a remove from perception of imagination, then how did science come into existence? We have to acknowledge the ease of clean dichotomies, and this is certainly one. The validity of Lévi-Strauss' knowledge claim is something to question, but what if it plays out? \n\nOne way it plays out is that civilizations experience a 'long pause' in scientific activity. The Dark Ages, right? All of human, scientific activity prior to the explosion of 'scientific' activity in the modern era as well. But the paradox reshapes that view. There was no pause, no great divide. Scientific activity took a different form. Some folks call these forms [[ethnobotany]], [[related]], and [[related]]. \n\n\n\n\u003e Their principal value is indeed to preserve until the present time the remains of methods of observation and reflection which were (and no doubt still are) precisely adapted to discoveries of a certain type: those which nature authorised from the starting point of a speculative organization and exploitation of the sensible world in sensible terms. This science of the concrete was necessarily restricted by its essence to results other than those destined to be achieved by the exact natural sciences but it was no less scientific and its results no less genuine. They were secured ten thousand years earlier and still remain at the basis of our own civilization. \n\u003e \n\u003e -- Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1962, The Science of the Concrete, p. 10-11\n\n\nA related work is [[Conner, C. - 2005 - A People's History of Science Chapter MOC]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-23T15:02:44.728277547Z","tags":null},"/Michael-Lynch-on-Expertise":{"title":"Michael Lynch on Expertise","content":"\n\u003eThe problem has to do with how Collins and Evans purport to ==settle== the reality question ==themselves== on the basis of their analytical judgments, ==rather than leaving it open to determination by participants and procedures in the institutions that social scientists investigate.== They acknowledge that there are different modes and degrees of expertise, and that not everyone who claims to be, or is designated as, an expert really is an expert, but they propose that they can determine what counts as a “real” expert, independent of the social occasions and relations in which the use of that social category is embedded (Lynch, p. 105).\n\u003e\n\u003e -- \u003ccite\u003eMichael Lynch\u003c/cite\u003e in his 1993 [[Scientific practice and ordinary action--ethnomethodology and social studies of science]]\n\nOne has to immediately acknowledge the badassery otherwise known as 'Michael Lynch.'
