I was expelled from high school when I was 15 years and court-ordered to obtain my GED at 16. I've since been on a journey of learning about learning. When you lack a 'formal' education you must learn new ideas in new ways and from and with new people. This has been both a challenge and a blessing in my life. This website is my attempt to make sense of my experiences and dialog with folks on their own learning journeys. \n\nI'm currently at [[On Being a Doctoral Student|Northwestern University]], pursuing a doctoral degree in [[On Becoming a Learning Scientist|learning sciences]]. My research interests -- and frankly my existence -- are grounded in liberatory educational experiences. That is, learning environments and moments that are interwoven with critical answers to critical questions of epistemology (whose knowledge matters?) and ontology (whose existence matters?). As much of my background is rooted in science, particularly organic chemistry, I am curious about: what do we learn about science, why, when, where, and from whom and for whom? \n\nWe find ourselves in an era of accountability and standards, where school communities adhere to 'expert' understandings of science -- largely [[Michael Lynch on Expertise|defined by those who work in academia]] (not unironically like myself). But what about all of the science and all of the scientists outside of the university? How do we recover and uplift those [[sites of science]] as pockets of scientific activity? How can we expand what we believe science is, how it is done, by whom, and for what purposes? What might this mean for our collective imagination in [[science education]]? These are a few questions that guide me.

If man is put 'to the question' along with 'science', it can be seen how: first, human rationality at work is impossible; second, the notion ofa discernible and distinctive 'scientific method' is as mythic as that of a 'cooking method', or an 'engineering method', or a 'method of management'.” \n\u003e \n\u003e -- (Fores, 1983, p. 160)\n\n\u003e “What has to be realized, is that a tool is a type of machine; and the human actor takes up, as in the case of man with man, a division of labour with machines in the work-place. Given that machines take on the tasks, and the parts of tasks shared with men, which are programmable, predictable, and describable in words and algebra, man (of the working pair) will always specialize on those sorts of function which demand personal skill and are sketched out in Section 3 above, in the context of the critique of the neolithic paradox idea. Man is given his job to do, because he is relatively good at dealing with risk and the unknown. Given this, he can neither afford to try to be rational, in the sense of operating for reasons which are apparent ex ante; nor should he sensibly aim to be 'methodical', in the sense of basing his conduct on articulable propositions.\"” \n\u003e \n\u003e -- (Fores, 1983, p. 161)\n\n\u003e “The greatest single trouble with the totemism of 'science' which has been discussed in this paper, concerns the way in which the special respect for 'science' has led to an apparent confirmation of the [[mechanomorphic]] view of man, which adheres to the 'humane' stance criticized by Collingwood in the passage from which a quotation was taken at the end of the previous section. If man is celebrated as a 'rational' being or as one which strives to act in such a way, the celebrant tends to lose sight of the fact that it is machine-behaviour which is characteristically more rational than that of human actors, in the sense discussed above; man is characteristically skillful in contrast. With accounts by the 'moderns', about an animate, powerful (*kräftig*) , anthropomorphic 'science', it is inevitable that man appears relatively inanimate, skill-less (craft-free), and (rationally) machine-like; the ritualistic celebration of a mythic 'scientific method' has contributed to this aberration.” \n\u003e \n\u003e -- (Fores, 1983, p. 161)\n\n\n\u003e “First, the totemic celebration of 'science' has to be excised from any record whose compiler wishes to be classed as scientific himself. This means dealing with the scientific 'paradox' of this paper, and concentrating on the only tenable meaning of, science', Science I. Second, historians would do well to drop an overt discussion of 'scientific discovery', and of 'revolution', when the real topic of concern is the long haul of creative invention by those who contribute to science. Third, scholars would do well to go back to Bacon, and discover what he really said and why. He who, \"for want of patience\", thrusts ahead and \"rejects ... sobriety, because it limits his hope\", is in danger of committing the worst error of the would-be scientist, confusing \"that which he prefers\" with that which the human senses indicate to be.” \n\u003e \n\u003e -- (Fores, 1983, p. 161)\n\n\n# Related\n- [[Conner, C. - 2005 - A People's History of Science MOC]]\n- [[Latour - 1993 - We have never been modern]]\n- [[Levi-Strauss - 1966 - Science of the Concrete]]\n- [[Michael Lynch on Expertise]]\n- [[Woolgar, S. - 1988 - Science, the very idea MOC]]\n- [[Francis Bacon]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-30T13:13:03.864056456Z","tags":null},"/ISLS-2023-Submissions":{"title":"ISLS 2023 Submissions","content":"\nThe International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS) is a conference hosted by the learning sciences [[On Becoming a Learning Scientist|(Learning Sciences?)]] 'premier' society: The [Iternational Society of the Learning Sciences](https://www.isls.org/).

These are certainly not a function of different stages of development of the human mind but rather of two strategic levels at which nature is accessible to scientific enquiry: one roughly adapted to that of perception and the imagination: the other at a remove from it. It is as if the necessary connections which are the object of all science, neolithic or modern, could be arrived at by two different routes, one very close to, and the other more remote from, sensible intuition.\n\u003e \n\u003e -- Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1962, The Science of the Concrete, p. 9\n\nThe paradox is how modern science came to be. A question can get this going: Prior to the existence (the human construction) of the modern scientific laboratory, did science exist? Given the tens of thousands of years of ‘practical’ (as polite code for ‘subjective’ and ‘not rigorous’) knowledge produced prior to modern laboratory science, how did science come to be? This isn't a historical question to be answered by looking at how humans formed institutions and how those institutions formed science. Some folks do that well, though: \n- [[Secord]]\n- [[Conner, C. - 2005 - A People's History of Science MOC]]\n\nRather, this is a question of human's interact with nature in the absence of institutional forces. \n\nThis plays into the ‘fairy tale’ story of modern science [[Woolgar, S. - 1988 - Science, the very idea MOC]], as if science somehow birthed, and now certifies [[Rouse, J. - 1996 - Beyond Epistemic Sovereignty]], itself. The paradox is how science could possibly come from non-science. *The*, not a, solution must be that nature has always been accessible by two means: that of disembodied cognitive processes removed from nature, and that of embodied, situated processes that get up close and personal with nature. Modern images of science would have us believe that the former is all is possible and that the latter is non-science. Ethnographic studies of science reveal, however, ‘the soft underbelly’ of scientific knowledge production, unraveling clean Cartesian divides between the mind and body, and unifying body and mind as one to advance science. \n\nWhat the heck does that mean? If nature was accessible to scientific inquiry prior to the invention of the modern laboratory which places nature at a remove from perception of imagination, then how did science come into existence? We have to acknowledge the ease of clean dichotomies, and this is certainly one. The validity of Lévi-Strauss' knowledge claim is something to question, but what if it plays out? \n\nOne way it plays out is that civilizations experience a 'long pause' in scientific activity. The Dark Ages, right? All of human, scientific activity prior to the explosion of 'scientific' activity in the modern era as well. But the paradox reshapes that view. There was no pause, no great divide. Scientific activity took a different form. Some folks call these forms [[ethnobotany]], [[related]], and [[related]]. \n\n\u003e Their principal value is indeed to preserve until the present time the remains of methods of observation and reflection which were (and no doubt still are) precisely adapted to discoveries of a certain type: those which nature authorised from the starting point of a speculative organization and exploitation of the sensible world in sensible terms. This science of the concrete was necessarily restricted by its essence to results other than those destined to be achieved by the exact natural sciences but it was no less scientific and its results no less genuine. They were secured ten thousand years earlier and still remain at the basis of our own civilization. \n\u003e \n\u003e -- Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1962, The Science of the Concrete, p. 10-11\n\n\nA related work is [[Conner, C. - 2005 - A People's History of Science MOC]]\nAnd [[Michael Lynch on Expertise]] also discusses who gets to count what and how\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-30T13:13:03.868056516Z","tags":null},"/Lynch1993":{"title":"Lynch (1993) Scientific practice and ordinary action","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-30T13:13:03.868056516Z","tags":null},"/Lynch1993-on-Schutz":{"title":"Lynch on Schutz: the world of thought and life and death","content":"\nIn [[Lynch1993]]\n\u003e Schutz's definition of the \"world of both the natural and the social scientist\" as a \"world of thought\" that differs radically from \"the world within which we act and within which we are born and die.\" \n\u003e \n\u003e -- Lynch, M.
