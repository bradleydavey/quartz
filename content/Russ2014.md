I'm always amazed by how some folks accomplish in 9 pages what it would take different folks 50 pages. Russ outlines an argument here that science education's emphasis on the practices of "professional scientists" sets up a tacit model of learning:

And Russ then argues for a new model:

![[Pasted image 20221126084808.png]]

I use quotes around "professional scientists" because it is clear in Russ' argument (and in the accounts of practices that I've read) that the scientists we ask learners to emulate are not at all professional. ==In fact, they aren't even people; they're scientific journal articles.== Russ' references make this clear (Dewey, Schwab, and Chin & Malhotra). Notably missing are the decades of ethnographic fieldwork of scientific activity. Why do science education researchers rarely draw on the ethnographic work done in laboratories?

Now, of course, Russ' argument against the tacit model of science education proposes its own tacit model, namely that the heretofore scholarship of practice has *actually* advanced the practices of professional scientists. It hasn't. In fact, it would be quite challenging to do. One of my principal understandings of ethnographic fieldwork of laboratory action is that there are not coherent, core scientific practices. This doesn't matter much in light of Russ' substitution: we should replace emphases of laboratory science with emphases on productive epistemologies (drawing on Elby & Hammer, 2001). That's all fine and good, but we do start to wade into murky water: how do we define productive? how do we evaluate it? productive toward what ends?

==If there's one argument I can get behind here, it's:==

> No longer would we be able to justify examining or promoting particular epistemologies or practices in science class merely because scientists do it.
> 
> -- Russ, 2014, p. 392 

Because the argument that learners should do something because scientists do it, is quite frankly, boring. Not only is this argument fallacious -- science education researchers largely do not know what actual scientists do, as evidenced by their literature base -- it also fails to take up one of the central arguments of the literature that it *should* reference. 

Science education research, by not taking up ethnographic fieldwork of scientific activities, advances a scientific mythology (a 'fairy tale' science; McDermott & Webber, 1998). In addition, science education research fails to engage in an inversion process called for by some of this myth-busting literature. In particular, Woolgar's (1988) work:

![[Pasted image 20221126084817.png]]

The image above is the classic view of science: the scientist represents nature (embodied as an object).

![[Pasted image 20221126084824.png]]

And thus, scientific knowledge is a representation of the natural world.

![[Pasted image 20221126084831.png]]

What if, however, it could be shown that scientific knowledge came first and gave rise to the natural world? What if how we choose to represent the natural world ('scientific knowledge') determines the natural world itself? If we expand this representation-object couple out into a process, we could find:

![[Pasted image 20221126084842.png]]

The main mode of representation in science (i.e., scientific journal articles; the leading image of science within science education; notably *not* scientists) is produced. This document is now advanced as the thing itself because few scientists are going to actually do the work of investigating the original object. The object, now advanced by the document, becomes divorced from the document. They are on equal  ontological footing: the object always existed in nature (e.g., an electron) and now the document also exists in a one-to-one capacity. If that's the case, then through some argumentation we can make it clear that the object existed first, and that the document simply represents it. And through a series of erasure (e.g., removing the human scientist from the journal article) we show that none of the documenting (the representing) matters, or perhaps ignore that it was even done, and we've come full circle:

![[Pasted image 20221126084848.png]]

So a question we have to ask ourselves is: if we've represented scientists' practices (which most science education researchers have not), have we done so in a way that sets up a false image? Are scientific practices ('science' practices in reform documents) the object or the representation in our scholarship? What implications might this have for science education?

One implication is clear. The following image becomes non-sensical: 

![[Pasted image 20221126084852.png]]

Because there never was such a thing as the left-hand part of the image. I think Russ' argument does a fine job of moving in the direction of falsifying leading images of scientific practice in science education. In particular, it's emphasis on epistemologies outside of science moves us outside of the laboratory and into the wider world. This is necessary. I have lots of questions about where we go now and why, but do agree with Russ on the idea that:

> Much of the work in the field has been in highlighting discontinuity between scientists’ and learners’ epistemologies, thereby reinforcing a deficit model of learners.
> 
> -- Russ, 2014, p. 390

But, this doesn't go far enough for me. A few steps more and we'd deconstruct the mythology of scientific epistemologies all-together: the greater deficit model of thinking that proposes scientific thinking at the top of a hierarchy. And a few steps more and we can now question the discipline divides that pervade American schooling. I'm not sure how I feel about that, but it's worth exploring.
