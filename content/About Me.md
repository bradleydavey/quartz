Hey - I'm Bradley. I was expelled from high school when I was 15 years and court-ordered to obtain my GED at 16. I've since been on a journey of learning about learning. When you lack a formal education you must learn new ideas in new ways and from and with new people. This has been both a challenge and a blessing in my life. This website is my attempt to make sense of my experiences and dialog with folks on their own learning journeys. 

I'm currently at Northwestern University, pursuing a doctoral degree in [[learning sciences]]. My research interests -- and frankly my existence -- are grounded in liberatory educational experiences. That is, learning environments and moments that are inextricably interwoven with critical answers to critical questions of epistemology (whose knowledge matters?) and ontology (whose existence matters?). As much of my background is also rooted in science, particularly organic chemistry, I am curious about: what do we learn about chemistry, why, when, where, and from whom and for whom? 

We find ourselves in an era of accountability and standards, where school communities adhere to 'expert' understandings of science -- largely [[Michael Lynch on Expertise|defined by those who work in academia]] (not unironically like myself). As such, and applying my curiosity questions to this paradigm, we may often find that we learn 'ready made chemistry' because we are told to learn chemistry in enclosed school environments separated from one's other communities. We are told to learn chemistry because it will help us in the future: for college and for jobs. We are also told to learn chemistry because we have no other choice, and if we engage in epistemic disobedience, we are expelled from school. We learn standards for standard-makers, mostly from 'experts' and for ourselves and our 'futures' -- not our families or our communities. While all of this is true, it does not have to be true. Thus, I'm interested in investigating how we change the status quo, why we do so, and for and with whom these changes happen.

If any of this resonates with you, write me on twitter and let's connect.
