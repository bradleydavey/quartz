A MOC is a Map of Content. It's a related set of ideas organized around a core topic. This idea was coined by X. I take the idea of a MOC and apply it to books here. While not book reviews, my book MOCs do include brief reviews at the beginning. That's just my attempt at [[On Becoming a Learning Scientist|becoming]] a better writer.
