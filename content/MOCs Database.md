A Map of Content (MOC) is an interrelated set of ideas organized around a core topic. This idea was coined by [Nick Milo](https://twitter.com/NickMilo). I take the idea of an MOC and apply it to books which expands a 'typical' book review into something of a Wiki page about that book. While not book reviews, my book MOCs do include brief reviews at the beginning. That's just my attempt at [[On Becoming a Learning Scientist|becoming]] a better writer.

<h2>Some MOCS </h2>

- [[Conner, C. - 2005 - A People's History of Science MOC]]
