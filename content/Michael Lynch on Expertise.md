>The problem has to do with how Collins and Evans purport to ==settle== the reality question ==themselves== on the basis of their analytical judgments, ==rather than leaving it open to determination by participants and procedures in the institutions that social scientists investigate.== They acknowledge that there are different modes and degrees of expertise, and that not everyone who claims to be, or is designated as, an expert really is an expert, but they propose that they can determine what counts as a “real” expert, independent of the social occasions and relations in which the use of that social category is embedded (Lynch, p. 105).
