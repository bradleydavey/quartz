> There is only one solution to the paradox, namely, that there are two distinct modes of scientific thought. These are certainly not a function of different stages of development of the human mind but rather of two strategic levels at which nature is accessible to scientific enquiry: one roughly adapted to that of perception and the imagination: the other at a remove from it. It is as if the necessary connections which are the object of all science, neolithic or modern, could be arrived at by two different routes, one very close to, and the other more remote from, sensible intuition.

The paradox is how modern science came to be. A question can get this going: Prior to the existence (the human construction) of the modern scientific laboratory, did science exist? Given the tens of thousands of years of ‘practical’ (as polite code for ‘subjective’ and ‘not rigorous’) knowledge produced prior to modern laboratory science, how did science come to be? This isn't a historical question to be answered by looking at how humans formed institutions and how those institutions formed science. Some folks do that well, though:

- [[Conner, C. - 2005 - A People's History of Science MOC]]

Rather, this is a question of human's interact with nature in the absence of institutional forces. 

This plays into the ‘fairy tale’ story of modern science [[Woolgar, S. - 1988 - Science, the very idea MOC]], as if science somehow birthed, and now certifies [[Rouse, J. - 1996 - Beyond Epistemic Sovereignty]], itself. The paradox is how science could possibly come from non-science. *The*, not a, solution must be that nature has always been accessible by two means: that of disembodied cognitive processes removed from nature, and that of embodied, situated processes that get up close and personal with nature. Modern images of science would have us believe that the former is all is possible and that the latter is non-science. Ethnographic studies of science reveal, however, ‘the soft underbelly’ of scientific knowledge production, unraveling clean Cartesian divides between the mind and body, and unifying body and mind as one to advance science. 

What the heck does that mean? If nature was accessible to scientific inquiry prior to the invention of the modern laboratory which places nature at a remove from perception of imagination, then how did science come into existence? We have to acknowledge the ease of clean dichotomies, and this is certainly one. The validity of Lévi-Strauss' knowledge claim is something to question, but what if it plays out? 

One way it plays out is that civilizations experience a 'long pause' in scientific activity. The Dark Ages, right? All of human, scientific activity prior to the explosion of 'scientific' activity in the modern era as well. But the paradox reshapes that view. There was no pause, no great divide. Scientific activity took a different form. Some folks call these forms [[ethnobotany]], [[related]], and [[related]]. 

> Their principal value is indeed to preserve until the present time the remains of methods of observation and reflection which were (and no doubt still are) precisely adapted to discoveries of a certain type: those which nature authorised from the starting point of a speculative organization and exploitation of the sensible world in sensible terms. This science of the concrete was necessarily restricted by its essence to results other than those destined to be achieved by the exact natural sciences but it was no less scientific and its results no less genuine. They were secured ten thousand years earlier and still remain at the basis of our own civilization.
