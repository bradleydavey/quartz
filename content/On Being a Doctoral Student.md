# Introduction
Being and becoming: two--perhaps *the* two--central questions of  Western [[philosophy]]. In [[On Becoming a Learning Scientist]] I write about what it's felt like, and feels like, to be in the process of becoming. What is the experience in a field that is diffusely defined, in the process of recreation, and where my academic ancestors are not primarily present? This is something of a becoming within a becoming.

In this longer-form note I discuss more general experiences I've had as a doctoral student.

I was never meant to pursue a PhD. I'm the first in my family to do so. My brother and I are the first in our family to finish college--and I didn't finish high school.
