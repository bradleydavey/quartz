## Main Ideas
#### what is science? how do we conceptualize science?
- “I have followed the example set by J. D. Bernal’s masterful Sccence in History, which he began by saying, “Science throughout is taken in a very broad sense and nowhere do I attempt to tramp 9) ——Tfnto a definition.”” (“A People's History of Science OCR1.pdf”, p. 10)
	- Bernal: science is taken in a very broad sense
- “Let us, [- therefore, take the most uncomplicated approach possible and for the purposes of this book simply consider science to be knowledge about nature and the associated snowledge-producing activities.” (“A People's History of Science OCR1.pdf”, p. 11)]
- here is our take: science and scientific activities are knowledge-producing activities ... knowledge about nature

#### what was the hand off between craft/artisan and modern professional science?
- ““The crafts first uncovered aspects of nature upon philosophies were later to be built,” and they remained th mary fount of nature Toug” (“A People's History of Science OCR1.pdf”, p. 14)

“Each of these techniques assumes centuries of active and methodical observation, of bold hypotheses tested by means of endlessly repeated experiments. ... There is no doubt that all these achievements required a genuinely scientific attitude, sustained and watchful interest and a desire for knowledge for its own sake. For only a small proportion of observations and experiments (which must be assumed to have been primarily inspired by a desire for knowledge) could have yielded practical and immediately useful results.*2” (“A People's History of Science OCR1.pdf”, p. 14)



“The historical priority of technology over theoretical science is most generally exemplified by the central theme of this book, Ned which is that artisans contributed not only the mass of empirica knowledge that furnished the raw material of the Scientific Revolution, K but the empirical method itself.
