Fores, M. (1983). Science and the ‘Neolithic Paradox.’ _History of Science_, _21_(2), 141–163. [https://doi.org/10.1177/007327538302100202](https://doi.org/10.1177/007327538302100202)

Michael Fores wrote in such a way that his texts would only be cheaped by added commentary:

> “...very little human endeavour, and perhaps none at all in the scientific and technical areas discussed in this paper, is well described as 'revolutionary' due to our activity as tinkerers, which flows itself from the distinctive human mastery of tools and machines. If man is put 'to the question' along with 'science', it can be seen how: first, human rationality at work is impossible; second, the notion ofa discernible and distinctive 'scientific method' is as mythic as that of a 'cooking method', or an 'engineering method', or a 'method of management'.”

> “What has to be realized, is that a tool is a type of machine; and the human actor takes up, as in the case of man with man, a division of labour with machines in the work-place. Given that machines take on the tasks, and the parts of tasks shared with men, which are programmable, predictable, and describable in words and algebra, man (of the working pair) will always specialize on those sorts of function which demand personal skill and are sketched out in Section 3 above, in the context of the critique of the neolithic paradox idea. Man is given his job to do, because he is relatively good at dealing with risk and the unknown. Given this, he can neither afford to try to be rational, in the sense of operating for reasons which are apparent ex ante; nor should he sensibly aim to be 'methodical', in the sense of basing his conduct on articulable propositions."”

> “The greatest single trouble with the totemism of 'science' which has been discussed in this paper, concerns the way in which the special respect for 'science' has led to an apparent confirmation of the [[mechanomorphic]] view of man, which adheres to the 'humane' stance criticized by Collingwood in the passage from which a quotation was taken at the end of the previous section. If man is celebrated as a 'rational' being or as one which strives to act in such a way, the celebrant tends to lose sight of the fact that it is machine-behaviour which is characteristically more rational than that of human actors, in the sense discussed above; man is characteristically skillful in contrast. With accounts by the 'moderns', about an animate, powerful (*kräftig*) , anthropomorphic 'science', it is inevitable that man appears relatively inanimate, skill-less (craft-free), and (rationally) machine-like; the ritualistic celebration of a mythic 'scientific method' has contributed to this aberration.”

> “First, the totemic celebration of 'science' has to be excised from any record whose compiler wishes to be classed as scientific himself. This means dealing with the scientific 'paradox' of this paper, and concentrating on the only tenable meaning of, science', Science I. Second, historians would do well to drop an overt discussion of 'scientific discovery', and of 'revolution', when the real topic of concern is the long haul of creative invention by those who contribute to science. Third, scholars would do well to go back to Bacon, and discover what he really said and why. He who, "for want of patience", thrusts ahead and "rejects ... sobriety, because it limits his hope", is in danger of committing the worst error of the would-be scientist, confusing "that which he prefers" with that which the human senses indicate to be.”
