- [[Aikenhead1996]] : cultural image of science; image of science is image of culture itself; [[Western science]]; mechanistic, materialistic, masculine, reductionistic, mathematically idealized, pragmatic, empirical, exploitive, elitist, ideological, inquisitive, objective, impersonal, rational, universal, decontextualized, communal, violent, value-free, and embracing disinterestedness, suspension of belief, and parsimony *education*
- [[AtkinsonEtAl2014]] : [[cold and hot sciences]]; mockups and cockups; image of science as 'stock of knowledge' that is produced by more reliable means that 'opinion, belief, guesses' etc.; ‘facts’ as being warranted in a way which does not apply to those other classes of knowledge (cf. Phillips, 1973); *education*
- [[Bacon1605]] // [[Bacon1905]] :  science as network: roads and sign posts; traveling and turning directions in response to findings; crucial experiments determine direction of pivot/travel; truth and utility are the same things; *science studies*

- [[BennettHogarth2009]] : image of science as NOT overlapping with images of students and their own identities; image of science as universally dislike—school science, not 'science outside school'; chemistry is least favorite; *education*
- [[Cartwright1983]] : science as NOT universal and generalizing; theories DEMAND constraints ceteris paribus; realism of entities, not theories; like [[Hacking1983]]

- [[Driver, R. et al. - 1996 - Young people's images of science|DriverEtAl1996]] : 
- [[Dunbar1994]] : goal-oriented, discovery, hypothesis rejection, social/sharing/discussing correlated with less 'rejection' of spurious findings and more 'explanation' of findings: ie not artifact, but what happened here and why?; confirmation; 'negative evidence' / discovery was hard to detect: happens socially, not abstract [[KnorrCetina1999]] *cog sci*

- [[Einsiedel1992]] : one side superiority; “A similar conclusion was reached by Einsiedel, whose analysis of a large and diverse sample of science articles in newspapers led her to portray the reporting of science as “a collection of ‘success’ stories.”51” (Zimmerman et al., 2001, p. 54) *communication studies*
- [[ethnoscience and scientific imagery]] : science as intentional problem solving, iterative investigations 
- [[Feyerabend]] : normative ethos can not possible lead to generative of scientific knowledge; hegemonic processes tend toward stable unifications under authoritative control; the way to explain generation and novel directions if deliberate transgression of norms; "The idea that science can, and should, be run according to fixed and universal rules is both unrealistic and pernicious ... All methodologies have their limitations and the only 'rule' that survives is 'anything goes'". (Feyerabend 1975: 295-6) *phil of sci from sci studies - Woolgar*
- [[Feyerabend1975]] : no common structure; tautology exposed : “if by 'science' we mean things done by scientists”; “Science is an essentially anarchic enterprise” (Feyerabend, 1975, p. 5) **counterinduction** // “It will have to be brought about by irrational means such as propaganda, emotion, ad hoc hypotheses, and appeal to prejudices of all kinds. We need these 'irrational means' in order to uphold what is nothing but a blind faith until we have found the auxiliary sciences, the facts, the arguments that tum the faith into sound 'knowledge” (Feyerabend, 1975, p. 114) / *phil of sci*
- [[Feyerabend1987]] : "narrow and self-serving 'rationalism' of those who are now using tax money to destroy the traditions of the taxpayers, to ruin their minds, rape their environment and quite generally to turn living human beings into well­ trained slaves of their own barren vision of life.” (Feyerabend, 1987, p. 10) // *need to update - phil of sci*
- [[Feyerabend1987a]] : mimesis; art/science; 'imitation'; “While the modern conception separates the human being from the world in a manner that turns interaction into an unsolvable problem (such as the mind-body problem), a Homeric warrior or poet is no stranger in the world but shares many elements with it. He may not 'act' or 'create' in the sense of the defenders of individual responsibility, free will, and creativity but he does not need such miracles to partake in the changes that surround him.'^” (Feyerabend, 1987, p. 139); image of practice/person as not separated; *phil of sci*
- [[FordForman2006a]] : consensus; construct/critique (context separation); The scientific disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology, and so forth) are social endeavors in which participants both collaborate and compete by debating what should be accepted as knowledge. These disciplines have ways of deciding upon knowledge claims that are neither arbitrary nor dogmatic. Authority emerges as an outcome of debates, and so it is the way that debates are decided that provides access to disciplinary authority. / evidence decides things : [[truth will out device (TWOD)]]  / controlling nature, 'capture' nature; scientist in communication with nature; *science education*
- [[FoxKeller1983]] : sensory, subjective / 'subjectivity' / conceptual barriers and scientific languages (explaining why science DOES NOT progress: [[Kuhn1970]] and [[Feyerabend1975]]); models/theories preempt divergent views and limit creativity; ie hegemonic; *history/phil of sci? biography of scientist*

- [[FunkEtAl2015]] :  scientists/non-scientist have different images of science; scientists think science education sucks, yet they largely determine science education; an increasing percentage of non-scientists who say that science makes life 'more difficult' / *Pew Research Center; survey*
- [[GarfinkelEtAl1981]] : the production of cultural objects, not only 'natural' objects; nature/reality/representations inseparable from local embodied shop practices; [[intertwining]]; science as practical action; although these characteristics describe 'discovery sciences' and not 'hard sciences'; discovery cannot lose its phenomenon; *science studies-sociologyEM*
- [[Giere1991]] : “They do experiments and make observations, some of which are designed to help them decide which of several possible ways the world might work is most like the way it really does work.” (Giere, 1991, p. 37); model construction, model testing, experimentation to test models; NOT 'objective' and 'rational' and shouldn't have been believed from the beginning; *philosophy*

- [[Gieryn1983]] : "science" is no single thing: characteristics attributed to science vary widely depending upon the specific intellectual or professional activity designated as "non-science," and upon particular goals of the boundary-work. The boundaries of science are ambiguous, flexible, historically changing, contextually variable, internally inconsistent, and sometimes disputed” (Gieryn, 1983, p. 792) / the three examples here vary from practical/useful to theory only; **why is non-science here?** *sociology; document analysis*
- [[Gieryn1995]] : science is a cultural space whose boundaries are determined by those who need to use the imagery; that space is filled;  *sociology; document analysis*
- [[Gieryn1999]] : science has no essential or universal qualities; science is increasingly fragmented; science is not even any small set of qualities! **against NOS**;  image of science as mutually exclusive; only some can be considered epistemically superior; some must be inferior---capitalism; images are reservoir of meanings; indeed how could we have such a reservoir of images each with their different meanings? *sociology; document analysis*
- [[GierynFigert1986]] : “The putatively self-correcting procedures of science guarantee that the truth will out; the rest is gossip (and not science).” (Gieryn, 1995, p. 434) **against consensus** ; image of science as self-correcting serves to bolster cultural authority of science: scientists will decide what's what and if you respect us we'll show you the truth; thus image of science as self-promoting and self-authorizing;  *sociology; document analysis*

- [[Gooding1992]] : science is embodied; embodied skill; "most are disembodied narrative reconstructions; “The familiar distinction between observation and experiment is another artifact of the disembodied, reconstructed character of retrospective accounts.” (Gooding, 1992, p. 68) // ie against [[FordForman2006a]] and [[NationalResearchCouncil2012]] and [[BerlandEtAl2016]] ... // “As we unravel reconstruction and move into the detail, we reach a level of analysis at which the dualistic ontology underlying the distinction between theory-concept and experiment-material world becomes untenable.” (Gooding, 1992, p. 73) *history of science*
- [[Goodwin1997a]] : embodied, sensorial, situated, 'restricted codes' rather than 'universal meanings'; “science is frequently depicted as the prototypical exemplar of disembodied abstract thought” (Goodwin, 1997, p. 127) but it isn't *ethnography*
- [[GottDuggan2008]] : experimental skill is not skill, it's knowledge of experimentation
- [[Gusterson2005]] : social, cultural, intergenerational, craft; experimentation AND NOT theory-testing; [[judgment]] ; *ethnography, interviews*
- [[Hacking1983]] : “image of mummified science” (Hacking, 1983, p. 2), like Gooding; **Popper/Carnap** “Both agreed that there is a fundamental difference between the context of justification and the context of discovery” (Hacking, 1983, p. 5); ie reject [[FordForman2006]], and co; science is collaboration between speculators, calculators, experimenters ([[Medawar1967]] relationship!); image of science as making USEABLE ENTITIES; *history / phil of sci*
	- [ ] a question of Hacking: does intervening/representation reify dichotomy? how does he address?

- [[Harding2008]] : “masculine, bourgeois, and Eurocentric character of the sciences,” (Harding, 2008, p. 102); concerned with the progress of certain people—not all people; science is at a distance from people's lives, especially women and non-western men BY DEFINITION; *review of research*
- [[Hodson1986]] : “Science is best regarded as a process with three distinct phases: creation, validation and incorporation into the body of knowledge.” (Hodson, 1986, p. 220) **there it is again**; compare to Hacking, Gooding, Kuhn and now images in school; *science education / phil*

- [[JaberHammer2016]] : 
- [[Kaur2015]] : not social, not cultural, achievement-oriented; utilitarian; discovering, theorizing, working on, writing books, developing and improving techniques, observing studying, formulating laws and hypotheses, designing equipment, experimenting, verifying, applying knowledge, proposing, synthesizing others' work; all men, mostly European; all alone! *analysis of textbooks*

- [[KellyEtAl1993]] : socially constituted enterprise shaped at many levels by human values, beliefs, and commitments; value-laden activities to demonstrate their correctness; norms are IDEOLOGY of science; *sci edu / cog sci*
- [[KlahrDunbar1993]] : concluded that the practice of science involves three main “processes,”5 which they refer to as hypothesizing, experimentation, and evidence evaluation.”; “process” of activity requiring reasoning that leads to the solution of three “problems” (developing hypotheses, generating data to test the hypotheses, and evaluating and coordinating evidence to draw a conclusion), and that these processes happen in phases”; “This description of science resembles [[Popper1972]] separation of conjecture and refutation of scientific hypotheses but adds a third aspect, evidence evaluation.” (Osborne, 2014, p. 584); *sci edu / cog sci*
